# Cat-Game-scratch-
It's a game programmed using scratch. It's a game about a cat searching for mice (3). The game consists of 3 levels that get harder with every level.


The game is about a cat chasing 3 mice. The player can control the cat's movements by arrows on the keyboard. The game consists of 3 levels and the main goal is to eat the mice by making the cat touch the mouse.
Also, it's important to stay away from the borders inside the game and to watch out for the dog. Anytime you touch any of those two things, the player must go back to the starting point but keep his score as it is.

Level One:

In the first level, the cat has to avoid the black borders inside while also achieving the main goal, catching the mice.

Level Two:

The second level gets harder by adding the dog. The dog keeps chasing the cat, so it makes it harder to catch the mice.

Level Three:

In the third level, the borders disappear but the mice start moving randomly and fast. Also, the dog moves faster than the last level.

As you can notice in the previous images, there are two bars on the left. The first one indicates the number of times the player dies. The second bar indicates how many mice the cat ate in each level.
